#Recipes
***
This is the first [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) on creating recipes using HTML. The project tests on working knowledge of using basic html tags to create elements such as parent tags (head, body) and their subseuent (children) tags (<p>, <a>, <img>, <h1>, etc. There are also a couple of attributes that have been introduced such as href, src, type, value, start, etc, which are used together with some tags.

The different receipes created are:
*[The Mediteranean Salad](https://github.com/StacyKioko/The-Odin_project/blob/main/Odin-recipes/recipes/salad.html)*
*[French Toast](https://github.com/StacyKioko/The-Odin_project/blob/main/Odin-recipes/recipes/toast.html)*
*[Taco Tuesday](https://github.com/StacyKioko/The-Odin_project/blob/main/Odin-recipes/recipes/taco.html)*
