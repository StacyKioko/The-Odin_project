<h1>#Recipes</h1>
***
This is the first [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) on creating recipes using HTML. The project tests on working knowledge of using basic html tags to create elements such as parent tags (head, body) and their subsequent (children) tags (p, a, img, h1, etc. There are also a couple of attributes that have been introduced such as href, src, type, value, start, etc, which are used together with some tags.

The different receipes created are:
<ul>
<li>[The Mediteranean Salad](https://github.com/StacyKioko/The-Odin_project/blob/main/Odin-recipes/recipes/salad.html)
