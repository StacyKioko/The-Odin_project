		<p>So you thought the famous French toast was from France? Me too and we are both <strong>wrong!</strong></p>
		<p>French toast (pain perdu in French) isn't actually from France. Legend has it that a man named Joseph French from the U.S. created the sweet breakfast dish in 1724 and named it after himself. However, that's probably not true: People were frying milk- and egg-soaked bread in Ancient Rome, according to early recipes.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>⅔ cup milk</li>
			<li>2 large eggs</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (Optional)</li>
			<li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon (Optional)</li>
			<li>salt to taste</li>
			<li>6 thick slices bread</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or more as needed</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Whisk milk, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt together in a shallow bowl.</li>
			<li>Lightly butter a griddle and heat over medium-high heat.</li>
			<li>Dunk bread in the egg mixture, soaking both sides. Transfer to the hot skillet and cook until golden, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Serve hot.</li>
